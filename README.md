# Elenta_metabolicReconstructions

This repository contains genome-scale metabolic model resources described in Noecker et al (2022):

- Curated metabolic reconstruction of *E. lenta* DSM 2243, both an unconstrained model and constrained to simulate growth in EDM1 media, in both Matlab and SBML format
- Relevant media compositions in BiGG format
- Partly curated reconstructions in Matlab format of 24 additional *E. lenta* strains
